# Compound Component Pattern in React

This project demonstrates the **Compound Component Pattern** in React, a design pattern that allows 
for flexible and reusable components by combining context-based state management with child components. 

## Features

- **Flexible Composition**: Build counters with customizable labels, controls, and display layouts.
- **Reusable Components**: Separate components for the label, count display, and buttons (`Increase`,
 `Decrease`) allow for modular usage.
- **State Management**: Shared state using React's `Context API` for seamless data flow between components.

## Components

- `Counter`: The parent component that provides context and manages the counter state.
- `Counter.Label`: Displays the label for the counter.
- `Counter.Count`: Displays the current counter value.
- `Counter.Increase`: A button to increment the counter.
- `Counter.Decrease`: A button to decrement the counter.

## How It Works

1. The `Counter` component uses the `Context API` to share state (`count`, `increase`, `decrease`) across its
 child components.
2. Each child component (`Label`, `Count`, `Increase`, `Decrease`) accesses the shared state using the 
`useContext` hook.
3. You can compose the child components in any order or layout while maintaining consistent state management.
